# MixedApp

This Repository contains a step-by-step guide on how to integrate React Native into an iOS application.

The repository starts with a simple app, with two tabs:
* The home tab is a native view where the team is going to work using native technologies
* The settings tab will be a React Native view.

Every commit represents a step toward integrating the React Native into the app.

You can checkout every commit to see if the current state of the project.

## [Initial Commit](https://github.com/cipolleschi/MixedApp/commit/c1f322cb7c124cb732d99cca1985278f1c951efc)

This commit is the initial state. We have the iOS app in the MixedApp folder and currently both tabs are native views.

The goal is to replace the Settings view with a React Native view.

## [Add the ios folder]()

First step to integrate React Native is to move your ios project into a dedicated ios folder.

1. create a new `ios` folder
2. move the `MixedApp` folder inside the `ios` folder
